## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
print("% for 30kg or more")
(1-pnorm(30,mean=40,sd=3))*100
print("% for 35-40kg")
pnorm(40, mean=40, sd=3)*100 - pnorm(35, mean=40, sd=3)*100
print("% for 40-45kg, is the same as above")
print("% for less than 45kg")
pnorm(45, mean=40, sd=3)*100
```
In 20 games, what is the probability exactly 5 successes?
```{r}
choose(20, 5) * 0.5^20
```
In 20 games, is the probability of at least 5 successes?
```{r}
x <- c(0,1,2,3,4)
sum = 0
for (val in x) {
  sum = sum + choose(20, val) * 0.5^20
}
1- sum
```
Can you find a neat way to calculate the probability of between 3 and 6 successes in 20 games?
```{r}
sum = 0
for (val in 3:6) {
  sum = sum + choose(20, val) * 0.5^20
}
sum
```
Question 3
Use dbinom() to calculate the probability of 5 successes in 20 games of dice.
```{r}
dbinom(5, size=20, prob=0.5)
```
Can you find a neat way to calculate the probability of between 3 and 6 successes?
```{r}
sum = 0
for (val in 3:6) { 
  sum = sum + dbinom(val, size=20, prob=0.5)
}
sum
```
Question 4
Generate samples from a Poisson Distribution to simulate the Post Office queue (where people join at an average rate of 120 per hour).
```{r}
x = rpois(10000, 120)
print("sample mean")
mean(x)
print("theoretical mean")
120
print("sample sd")
sd(x)
print("theoretical sd")
sqrt(120)
```
Question 5
Without generating samples, calculate the median interval (in seconds) between people joining the Post Office queue
```{r}
median(qexp(0.5, rate=1/30))
```
Question 6
A casino game has a jackpot that pays out on average once every hour. Suppose that the jackpot was last triggered at 00:00.

What is the probability that the next jackpot will happen between 00:00 and 01:00?
```{r}
ppois(0, 1, lower=FALSE)
```
What is the probability that the next jackpot will happen between 01:00 and 02:00?
```{r}
ppois(0, 1) * ppois(0, 1, lower=FALSE)
```
If the jackpot does not happen between 00:00 and 01:00, what is the probability that it will happen between 01:00 and 02:00?
```{r}
ppois(0, 1, lower=FALSE)
```

Question 7
Choose the statistical distribution that best represents each of the following situations, and explain why:

Grades in an introductory organic chemistry course.
t dist
The number of M&Ms of each colour in a pack.
t dist
The chance of drawing a card from the suit of Spades in a standard 52-card deck.
binomial
The number of emails received in a given hour during a workday.
poisson
The number of flight passengers at different gates in an airport.
